# CustomRadixSort
My implementation of radix sort (developed without knowledge of radix sort)

Date of Completion:

I created this sorting algorithm by inspiration before I had learned about non-comparison sorting algorithms. Eventually, through research, I discovered that my algorithm was actually very closely related to Radix Sort

Implementation of RadixSort can be found here:
